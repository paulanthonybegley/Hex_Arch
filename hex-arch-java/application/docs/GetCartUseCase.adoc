The customer should be able to retrieve their shopping cart, including the products, their respective quantity, the total number of products, and the total price

The primary port is GetCartUseCase:

[,java]
----
package com.example.shop.application.port.in.cart;

import com.example.shop.model.cart.Cart;
import com.example.shop.model.customer.CustomerId;

/**
 * Use case: Retrieving a shopping cart.
 *
 * @author Paul Anthony Begley
 */
public interface GetCartUseCase {

  Cart getCart(CustomerId customerId);
}

----

The implementation of above port is GetCartService which forwards the call to the repository method findByCustomerId, which was created in the previous use case.  In shopping cart exists then a ew one is created so this method never returns null.

[,java]
----
public class GetCartService implements GetCartUseCase {

  private final CartRepository cartRepository;

  public GetCartService(CartRepository cartRepository) {
    this.cartRepository = cartRepository;
  }

  @Override
  public Cart getCart(CustomerId customerIdVeryLong) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(customerIdVeryLong, "'customerId' must not be null");

    return cartRepository
        .findByCustomerId(customerIdVeryLong)
        .orElseGet(() -> new Cart(customerIdVeryLong));
  }
}

----

Remember that the calculation of the total number of products and the total price was earlier implemented in the Cart model class.

Sidenote
In order to get mokito to work with Java 21, I had to include the latest dependency to bytebuddy

[,xml]

<dependency>
    <groupId>net.bytebuddy</groupId>
    <artifactId>byte-buddy</artifactId>
    <version>1.15.11</version>
