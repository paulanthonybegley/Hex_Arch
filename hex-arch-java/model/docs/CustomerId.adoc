The CustomerId is implemented as a record in order to make it immutable.  It acts as a wrapper around the primitive int style, this allows use to impart the semantics as being different to a primitive int.  

[,java]
----
package com.example.shop.model.customer;

/**
 * A customer ID value object (enabling type-safety and validation).
 *
 * @author Paul Anthony Begley
 */
public record CustomerId(int value) {

  public CustomerId {
    if (value < 1) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("'value' must be a positive integer");
    }
  }
}

This approach gives two advantages:

1. We can ensure the CustomerId is valid as to Business rules.
2. We can pass customer id in a type safe way.  If it were int then easy to accidentally swap arguments to a method/function taking multiple int parameters.
