In this code excursion the aim is to implement a simple project using DDD and TDD within the hexagonal architecture.

The use cases to cover are:

1. Searching for products
2. Adding a product to the shopping cart
3. Retrieving the shopping cart with the products, their respective quantity and total price
4. Emptying the shopping cart.

The business logic will unsure:

* The amount of product added to the cart must be at least one
* After adding a product then the total quantity for that product must not exceed the availability within the warehouse.

The technologies to be used:

* Java 17, without any frameworks.  In the future, Spring and Quarkus will be integrated.
* RestEasy as an implementation of jakarta RESTFUL web services, formerly JAX-RS.
* Undertow as lightweight web server.
* ArchUnit to verify compliance with architectural boundaries
* Lombok to save some boilerplate code.

It will follow a test-driven approach:

* For each domain entity, we will write a unit test
* For each domain service, we will write a unit test
* For each adapter, we will write an integration test
* For critical use cases, we will write end-to-end tests.

We will alo integrate CI/CD tool "Github Actions" to build project on GitHub and perform static code analysis.
